# A Deep Dive Into JAVA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Creating your first JAVA program:

Things to remember:
1. Every JAVA file ends with .java extension.
2. The name of the file is the same as the name of the class. For example, refer to FirstJavaProgram.java.
3. When a .java file is compiled into byte code, the new file generated has the extension of .class.
4. Compile the .java file into bytecode with the command: "javac FirstJavaProgram.java".
5. Run the byte code with the command : "java FirstJavaProgram".
